# BeatTime Development Tasks

This file outlines the development tasks for the BeatTime application, based on the Product Requirements Document.

## Phase 1: Core MVP Development

### F1.1 Web Audio Engine & Timing Accuracy
- [ ] Implement Web Audio API for real-time microphone processing.
- [ ] Develop an AudioContext-based amplitude detection algorithm for note onsets.
- [ ] Calculate timing accuracy of detected onsets against a metronome beat.
  - [ ] Ensure latency is below 50ms.
- [ ] Add adjustable sensitivity for different instruments and environments.
- [ ] Test and ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### F1.2 PWA Metronome System
- [ ] Create a precise visual and audio metronome using the Web Audio API scheduler.
  - [ ] Support tempos from 40-200 BPM.
  - [ ] Implement common time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 2/4).
- [ ] Allow for customizable click sounds using audio buffers.

### F1.3 Practice Sessions & UI
- [ ] Implement browser-based session recording and timing analysis.
- [ ] Display real-time accuracy feedback during a practice session.
- [ ] Create a session summary page with detailed statistics (accuracy percentage, streak).
- [ ] Implement basic UI for the practice session.
- [ ] Store practice history locally using localStorage.

### F1.4 Basic Scoring & PWA
- [ ] Implement streak tracking and personal best records in local storage.
- [ ] Log practice time and session analytics.
- [ ] Set up the app as a basic Progressive Web App (PWA) with a manifest file.
- [ ] Ensure core features are available offline.

## Phase 2: Gamification

- [ ] Design and implement a user leveling system (Novice to Master).
- [ ] Create an achievement system for practice and accuracy milestones.
- [ ] Implement daily challenges with rotating types (speed, accuracy, etc.).
- [ ] Develop an advanced scoring system with combos and bonuses.

## Phase 3: Social Features (Requires Backend)

- [ ] Implement user management with Firebase Authentication.
  - [ ] Add social logins (Google, etc.).
  - [ ] Sync profiles across devices using Firestore.
- [ ] Build a friend system with activity feeds.
- [ ] Develop a 1v1 real-time Battle Mode using WebRTC.
- [ ] Create global and friend-based leaderboards.
- [ ] Add social sharing capabilities for achievements and results.

## Phase 4: Advanced Training

- [ ] Develop progressive training modes (e.g., Fade-Out Metronome).
- [ ] Add support for advanced rhythm patterns and complex time signatures.
- [ ] Implement visual notation for rhythms.
- [ ] Integrate educational content and tutorials.
